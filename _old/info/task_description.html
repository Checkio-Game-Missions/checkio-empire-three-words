    Let's teach the Robots to distinguish words and numbers.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a string with words and numbers separated by whitespaces (one space).
    The words contains only letters.
    You should check if the string contains three words in <strong>succession</strong>.
    For example, the string "start 5 <strong>one two three</strong> 7 end" contains three words in succession.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A string with words.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The answer as a boolean.
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio("Hello World hello") == True
checkio("He is 123 man") == False
checkio("1 2 3 4") == False
checkio("bla bla bla bla") == True
checkio("Hi") == False
    </pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This teaches you how to work with strings and introduces some useful functions.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    The input contains words and/or numbers. There are no mixed words (letters and digits combined).<br>
    0 &lt; len(words) &lt; 100
